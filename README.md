Hello, I am sending you my project, thanks for the opportunity!
Use vuetify outside of laravel :), laravel I only have it as back, you can see it in the code, the commerce folder has the front
I have never used the spatie laravel-medialibrary component, but it is also integrated in the project!
1. composer install
2. Create .env and set APP_URL with the url of the site, set the data of the database server.
3. Run the migrations
4. Run InitiatorSeeder -> php artisan db: seed --class = InitiatorSeeder
5. Activate storage -> php artisan storage: link

I hope and it works :)
